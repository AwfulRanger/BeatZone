# How to play

Any map with a nav file will work.  
Additionally, enemy spawn points and other entities can be manually placed by the mapmaker or a developer.
Custom enemy spawn points have already been placed for Team Fortress 2's Mann vs. Machine maps.

Pressing the menu keys *(F1, F2, F3, and F4 by default)* will open up the menu.
Each key opens a different tab of the menu; help, character, vote, and settings, respectively.
